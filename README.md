### Description
The premise of this project is to create a multiplayer poker game that can be played between players on the same network. The host server will be run on the computer of the player that initializes a session of poker, and every player will connect to that host. The poker will be based on Texas holdâ€™em, but may not necessarily adhere to its entire ruleset. Players can bet with virtual currency, and each player will start with a predetermined minimum amount.
